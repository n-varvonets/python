# 1) Представь себя:
# я люблю в свободное время постигать такие как itdvn  и прорабатывать книгу марка лутца пайтон 3 издание, смотрю хабр

# но если вкратце, то:
# 1) проанализировать всевозможные источники в интеренете, которые имеют данные о стартапах и по возможности заскрапить
# их, а если не получится то через api получить как можно больше данных
# 2) их запарсить с четкой структурой для части меш.лернинг и фронтенда и внести в бд
# 3)мсоздать работающий api  с нашой бд с помощью no-beckend  фрейморка pgREST и использовать traefik для проксирования запросов


"""me"""
# I was born and raised in Odessa
# I've been interested in football and computer games since I was a kid.
# Even I have my own achievements in this sport (two-time Ukrainian Cup winner and three-time Ukranian champion in my age group...was a member of the national team )
"""education"""
#  I received my bachelor's degree in speciality of petroleum engineering in Odessa National Academy of Food
#  Tech and the master's degree by the same speciality I got in National University of Oil and Gas in Ivano-Frankivsk.
#  I was working by my speciality approximately for a year and half. I was disappointed because of being an honest
#  engenier by your own efforts and knowleges you will not achieve a higher postion.
"""why i go into IT"""
# And because I've liked technology since I was a kid and my older brother works as a prigrammer,
# I decided to try my hand at it under my older brother's mentorship
#  and I have been working as a programmer for about a year and a half now and I am happy that I chose this path
"""current work and why I want to quiet"""
# well, at the head of it all is the material basis
# One of the reasons why I want to change jobs is that I am given to work with everything and not with what I want.
# So for me, the technology stack that I will be working with is important. I want to get real experience working with:
#     - DjangoREST, Celery;
#     - Docker, CI/CD.
"""expectations from team"""
# it's important that the team has to be united one general point and also there is a good communcation
# and support of each other as one team
"""salary"""
# depends on the conditions of the relocation, but in the amount of one and a half thousand
